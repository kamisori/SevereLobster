maven 3.0.4

Maven is a Java tool, so you must have Java installed in order to proceed.
More precisely, you need a Java Development Kit (JDK)

Additional optional installation steps are listed after the platform specific instructions.

Windows 2000/XP

    Unzip the distribution archive, i.e. apache-maven-3.0.4-bin.zip to the directory you
    wish to install Maven 3.0.4. These instructions assume you chose
    C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation. The subdirectory apache-maven-3.0.4 will
    be created from the archive.
    Add the M2_HOME environment variable by opening up the system properties (WinKey + Pause),
    selecting the "Advanced" tab, and the "Environment Variables" button, then adding the 
    M2_HOME variable in the user variables with the value 
    C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\apache-maven-3.0.4.
    Be sure to omit any quotation marks around the path even if it contains spaces.
    Note: For Maven < 2.0.9, also be sure that the M2_HOME doesn't have a '\' as last character.
    In the same dialog, add the M2 environment variable in the user variables with the value %M2_HOME%\bin.
    Optional: In the same dialog, add the MAVEN_OPTS environment variable in the user variables
    to specify JVM properties, e.g. the value -Xms256m -Xmx512m. This environment variable can
    be used to supply extra options to Maven.
    In the same dialog, update/create the Path environment variable in the user variables
    and prepend the value %M2% to add Maven available in the command line.
    In the same dialog, make sure that JAVA_HOME exists in your user variables
    or in the system variables and it is set to the location of your JDK, e.g.
    C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_02 and that %JAVA_HOME%\bin is in your Path environment variable.
    Open a new command prompt (Winkey + R then type cmd) and run mvn --version to verify that
    it is correctly installed.

    Change directory in cmd to project-folder (D:\GitHub\SevereLobster\projekt), where pom.xml is located
    Use command "mvn clean install" without quotes to install

Unix-based Operating Systems (Linux, Solaris and Mac OS X)

    Extract the distribution archive, i.e. apache-maven-3.0.4-bin.tar.gz to the directory you
    wish to install Maven 3.0.4. These instructions assume you chose /usr/local/apache-maven.
    The subdirectory apache-maven-3.0.4 will be created from the archive.
    In a command terminal, add the M2_HOME environment variable, e.g. export
    M2_HOME=/usr/local/apache-maven/apache-maven-3.0.4.
    Add the M2 environment variable, e.g. export M2=$M2_HOME/bin.
    Optional: Add the MAVEN_OPTS environment variable to specify JVM properties,
    e.g. export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xms256m -Xmx512m". This environment variable can be
    used to supply extra options to Maven.
    Add M2 environment variable to your path, e.g. export PATH=$M2:$PATH.
    Make sure that JAVA_HOME is set to the location of your JDK, e.g. export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.5.0_02 and that $JAVA_HOME/bin is in your PATH environment variable.
    Run mvn --version to verify that it is correctly installed.

    Change directory in cmd to project-folder (D:\GitHub\SevereLobster\projekt), where pom.xml is located
